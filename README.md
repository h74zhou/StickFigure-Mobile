# Ragdoll Android Mobile Application

### Introduction

This project was made for the Final Assignment of CS349 (User Interfaces) Spring 2019 term. The app demonstrates matrix movement transformations in the form of a ragdoll. Users can transform the human ragdoll by translating, rotating and scaling its limbs through direct manipulation.

### Technical Requirements

There are 3 menu bar items. Reset returns the doll to its starting size and position. About displays a popup with the application name, name and student number. To return from the About Page to the application, use the "back button". Please test this application on a Pixel C simulator in landscape orientation. You can load the apk in the parent directory:

```
app-debug.apk
```

### Bonus Feature

The third menu bar item is the "switch ragdoll" button. This switches the human ragdoll to a "dog" ragdoll. This ragdoll was meant to fulfill the "multiple ragdoll" requirement feature. The dog has 5 body parts: head, torso, front leg, back leg and tail. The head, legs and tail can be rotated. The torso can be dragged and translated. The tail can also be scaled.
