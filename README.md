# StickFigure Matrix Manipulations Android Game

### Introduction

This project was made for the Final Assignment of CS349 (User Interfaces) Spring 2019 term. All features required were implemented. The app demonstrates matrix movement transformations in the form of a ragdoll. Users can transform the human ragdoll by translating, rotating and scaling its limbs through direct manipulation (point and drag). **The project received a 100% final evaluation!**

### Technical Requirements

There are 3 menu bar items. "RESET" returns the doll to its starting size and position. "ABOUT" displays a popup with the application name, name and student number. To return from the "ABOUT" page to the application, use the "back button" on your android device. Please test this application on a Pixel C simulator in landscape orientation. You can load the apk in the parent directory:

```
app-debug.apk
```

### Bonus Feature

The third menu bar item is the "SWITCH RAGDOLL" button. This switches the human ragdoll to a "dog" ragdoll (and vice versa). This ragdoll was meant to fulfill the "multiple ragdolls" requirement for this assignment. The dog has 5 body parts: head, torso, front leg, back leg and tail. The head, legs and tail can be rotated. The torso can be dragged and translated. The tail can also be scaled.
